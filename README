This is a standalone read surfgen surface routine
Please make sure ifort is available and $MKLROOT variable is properly set

in the source directory, execute:
make clean
make
this will create two executables,
main.x for a simple test plot of surfaces, and
evalsurf.x for a evaluation subroutine

in t1 directory or coupled-s0-s1 directory
execute
../source/main.x
../source/evalsurf.x geom.test
to test the performance

To incoorporate the evaluatesurfgen subroutine into your own program,
include libsurfgen.a in the compilation and
call EvaluateSurfgen(geom,e,cg,h,dcg)
geom : input (3,natoms) array
e    : energies (nstates) array for energy of s0, s1 respectively. Note for t1 they are equal
cg   : energy gradients
h    : diabatic Hamiltonian matrix (nstates*nstates) array
dcg  : diabatic energy gradients
